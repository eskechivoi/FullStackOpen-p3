# FullStackOpen - part 3

Exercises done on the FullStackOpen course (https://fullstackopen.com/).

In this course I learned how to build single page applications with ReactJS that use REST APIs built with Node.js, and a little introduction to GraphQL.
This repository contains the exercises corresponding to NodeJS, Express and building REST APIs.
